# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) puzzles, implemented using the Python programming language.

## Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

## Structure

Each day's puzzles are organized in separate directories named `day01`, `day02`, etc. Inside each day's directory, there are subdirectories for each puzzle, `part1` and `part2`. 

At the root level there is also a `template.py` file that can be used as a starting point.

## Running Solutions

To run a solution, navigate to the specific day directory (e.g., `day01`), create a file named `input.txt`, and insert your puzzle input.

Then navigate to the `part1` or `part2` subdirectory and run the following command:
```bash
python output.py
```

This will print the solution for that specific puzzle.
